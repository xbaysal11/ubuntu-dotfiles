Polybar Support
===============

Reading [Polybar Wiki](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/wiki) should help you with most of the problems you encounter when using polybar. It has a page for each module, describing what it does and what configuration options it provides.

If you can't find the information you are looking for on the wiki, look through the existing [issues](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/issues?q=is%3Aissue), to see if anyone had the same problem before.

If you are still not able to resolve your problem, go ahead and open a new issue and also document what you have done up to that point to solve the problem.
