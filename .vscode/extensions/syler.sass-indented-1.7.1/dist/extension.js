But if you request a font size of, say, 9 with a scale of 140%, the resulting font size of 12.6 doesn\'t explicitly exist in the font system, so the browser rounds the font size to 12 instead. This results in stair-step scaling of text. But the geometricPrecision property — when fully supported by the rendering engine — lets you scale your text fluidly. For large scale factors, you might see less-than-beautiful text rendering, but the size is what you would expect—neither rounded up nor down to the nearest font size supported by Windows or Linux.
