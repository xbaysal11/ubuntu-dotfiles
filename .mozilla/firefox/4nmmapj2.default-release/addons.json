The websites and apps that you use are under attack every day. Security breaches occur and your passwords are stolen. When you reuse the same passwords across apps and websites hackers can easily access your email, bank, and other important accounts.\n\nSecurity experts recommend that you use a different, randomly generated password for every account that you create. But how do you manage all those passwords? Bitwarden makes it easy for you to create, store, and access your passwords.\n\nBitwarden stores all of your logins in an encrypted vault that syncs across all of your devices. Since it's fully encrypted before it ever leaves your device, only you have access to your data. Not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data, even if we wanted to. Your data is sealed with AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256.\n\nBitwarden is 100% open source software. The source code for Bitwarden is hosted on GitHub and everyone is free to review, audit, and contribute to the Bitwarden codebase.","weeklyDownloads":14858,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Bitwarden Inc.","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12533945/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178966.png?modified=1543520687","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178966.png?modified=1543520687","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Sync and access your vault from multiple devices"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178965.png?modified=1543520688","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178965.png?modified=1543520688","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Manage all your logins and passwords from a secure vault"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178939.png?modified=1543520689","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178939.png?modified=1543520689","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Quickly auto-fill your login credentials into any website that you visit"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178940.png?modified=1543520690","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178940.png?modified=1543520690","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Your vault is also conveniently accessible from the right-click context menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178941.png?modified=1543520690","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178941.png?modified=1543520690","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Automatically generate strong, random, and secure passwords"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/178/178943.png?modified=1543520691","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/178/178943.png?modified=1543520691","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Your information is managed securely using AES-256 bit encryption"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.8013,"reviewCount":1052,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/reviews/","updateDate":1585083661000},{"id":"{7a7a4a92-a2a0-41d1-9fd7-1e92480d612d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-32.png?modified=1542603952","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-64.png?modified=1542603952","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-128.png?modified=1542603952"},"name":"Stylus","version":"1.5.11","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3553643/stylus-1.5.11-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://add0n.com/stylus.html","supportURL":"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues","description":"Redesign your favorite websites with Stylus, an actively developed and community driven userstyles manager.

Easily install custom themes from popular online repositories, or create, edit, and manage your own personalized CSS stylesheets.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    Versatility of theme installation options. Stylus supports installs from popular online repositories. Additionally, styles can now also be installed from .user.css or .user.styl URLs (see Usercss format documentation in our github wiki).\n    A backup feature for your entire database of installed styles which is compatible with other userstyles managers.\n    An intuitive and configurable automatic update function for installed styles.\n    A highly customizable UI, including theming, optional layouts, icon and badge color choices, along with many other tweaks.\n    Two different optional code validators with user configurable rules.\n\n\nUseful Links\n\n    Source code: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus\n    Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/fCVvGwoF5cQ\n    Chat room: https://discord.gg/tzXVNJz\n    Frequently asked questions: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ\n    Technical bug report: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues\n    General discussion and bug report: https://add0n.com/stylus.html#reviews\n    Localization: https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus/dashboard/\n\n\nPermissions\n\nStylus uses only a small subset of each permission. As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":4246,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":473,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":453,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","thumbnailWidth":538,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","thumbnailWidth":423,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","thumbnailWidth":380,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5764,"reviewCount":250,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1587634753000},{"id":"FirefoxColor@mozilla.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1004/1004409-32.png?modified=25bcff7a","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1004/1004409-64.png?modified=25bcff7a","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1004/1004409-128.png?modified=25bcff7a"},"name":"Firefox Color","version":"2.1.5","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3387078/firefox_color-2.1.5-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://color.firefox.com","supportURL":null,"description":"Build, save and share beautiful Firefox themes.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":9337,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/216/216725.png?modified=1553195362","width":2174,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/216/216725.png?modified=1553195362","thumbnailWidth":580,"thumbnailHeight":480},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/216/216723.png?modified=1553195362","width":2174,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/216/216723.png?modified=1553195362","thumbnailWidth":580,"thumbnailHeight":480},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/216/216724.png?modified=1553195362","width":2174,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/216/216724.png?modified=1553195362","thumbnailWidth":580,"thumbnailHeight":480}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4679,"reviewCount":119,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/reviews/","updateDate":1566985523000},{"id":"{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/1/1865-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Adblock Plus","version":"3.8.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3539016/adblock_plus-3.8.4-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://adblockplus.org/","supportURL":"http://adblockplus.org/forum/","description":"One of the most popular free ad blockers for Firefox.
